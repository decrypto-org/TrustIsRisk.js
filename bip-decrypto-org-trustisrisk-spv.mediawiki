==Abstract==

This BIP describes the needed extensions to the communication protocol of servers with SPV nodes in order to enable efficient
transfer of relevant [https://github.com/decrypto-org/TrustIsRisk.js Trust is Risk] transactions for the calculation of
indirect trust.

==Specification==

==Motivation==

==Rationale==

==Backwards compatibility==

This BIP does not in any way create backwards compatibility issues (hopefully). Existing SPV nodes can still use Bloom filters
according to [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki BIP 37] without any need to account for the
extensions proposed in this document.
